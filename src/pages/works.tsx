      The main goal was to learn how to design more difficult WEB systems like admin panel. 
      In this system Iâ€™ve created dashboard and table of all recipes. 
      This admin panel has two colour modes - dark and light. 
      The mode depends on OS colour mode which user is using. 
      Also, user can change mode manually.

          As I mentioned before, I am really interested in WEB design during my free time. 
          Especially in the latest trends of graphic elements, colours and design systems. 
          Also, I just love when WEB design is user friendly. 
          <br/><br/>
          All of my examples, which you will find above, are created using specifications of Material UI.
